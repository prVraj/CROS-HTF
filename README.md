## CROS - CONTACTLESS RESTAURANT ORDERING SYSTEM

Upon arrival at the hotel/restaurant, guests connect to the open WiFi, automatically redirecting them to a QR code scanner webpage. They use the page to scan table-specific QR codes, accessing menus, and placing orders independently, streamlining the dining experience and enhancing customer satisfaction through seamless technology integration.
